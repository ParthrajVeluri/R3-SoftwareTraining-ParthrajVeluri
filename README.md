Color code for wires: 
Dark blue: signal wires; sends input signals to the arduino
Light blue/brown : takes in output signals coming from the arduino 
Orange : Motor wires; sends high/low input signals to the motor
Red : power 
Black : ground 

How the Code works: 
Dipswitches
The motors have five overall states they could be in (forward, backwards, right, left, stop) which are controlled by the dip switches. 
Dipswitch 1 turns the foward state on. 
Dipswitch 2 turns the backward state on.
Dipswitch 3 turns the right state on.
Dipswitch 4 turns the left state on. 
When no dipswitches are turned on the motors will be in the stop state. 
NOTE: ONLY ONE DIPSWITCH SHOULD BE ON AT A GIVEN TIME. 

Potentiometer (Variable resistor) 
The speed of the motors can be adjusted VIA PWM using the the potentiometer which is a fully analog component of the circuit. It increases the resistance of the power going to the motors thus overall controlling their speed. The speed can be controlled by turning the potentiometer and set to ones liking.
